How KYG Works
KYG is a blockchain token backed by real gold owners who register their holdings on the blockchain. This provides public accountability, ensuring that any attempt to seize registered gold will be visible and contestable.
Key features include: 
✅ Blockchain-Based Ownership Registry – Secure, immutable, and verifiable gold ownership records.
✅ Decentralized Protection – No single entity can seize KYG-registered gold.
✅ Seamless Trading & Transferability – Owners can freely trade or transfer their KYG tokens.
✅ Eliminates Secrecy Risks – Owners no longer need to hide their gold to protect it. 
✅  Eliminate owner identity Risks – gold owner personal identity will not be disclosed to anyone, token will be available on an encrypted address and can be changed anytime .
✅ Eliminate Owner Gold from Confiscation – If any individual or institution attempts to seize the owner's gold, they will be held accountable by the market.
✅ Eliminate Transporting Risk – A blockchain ledger recording the quantity, quality, and location of physical gold eliminates the risk of loss during transportation. The physical gold will remain in place, with only the ledger being updated.
